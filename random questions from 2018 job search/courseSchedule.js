// of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

//     For example, given 2 and [[1,0]], there are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished
// course 0. So it is possible.

// have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
